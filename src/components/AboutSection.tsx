        Currently pursuing my Degree in{" "}
        <span className="font-medium">Computer Science</span>. This world of coding and the endless possibilities you can achieve through this one skill will never cease to amaze meâ€” the problems you can solve, the creative expression you can showcase.
        <span className="italic">My favorite part of programming</span> is the
        problem-solving aspect. I <span className="underline">love</span> the
        feeling of finally figuring out a solution to a problem. 
        </p>
        <p>
        Currently in a phase of exploration, trying out different tools to craft my journey. From enhancing my problem-solving skills in core Java, to building some fun apps using Flutter, to now currently exploring the world of web-development using NextJs and Full stack frameworks.
        </p>
        <p>
        In the future, I would love to explore web 3.0 and the vast world of AI and ML.
